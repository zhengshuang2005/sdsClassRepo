On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	QW_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

means: 1: I am on main branch, in synced with the remote repository; 2: The "untracked files" means the QW_noadd txt.. is not added into the git repository, not added, not committed, not pushed. The last line shows me that no file is added to commit. At this time I only have i untracked file "QW_noadd"
