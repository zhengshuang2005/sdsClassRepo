I have used github before, but mainly for sharing some code with people whilhile taking classes, or for downloading some handy small applications for my research. For uploading or publishing files on github, before i only know how to uploadd through the website to my repositories. Now I know how to directly push and full files from Frontera or my local machine. This is actually pretty convinient.
